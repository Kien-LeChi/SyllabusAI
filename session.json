            "content": "The session begins with a 'Hook' activity to challenge existing mental models. The teacher asks the class to write pseudocode for detecting whether a photo contains a cat or a dog using only 'if-else' statements (e.g., 'if ears == pointy'). The teacher then displays edge cases, such as a dog with pointy ears or a curled-up cat, to demonstrate the failure of rule-based programming for complex, messy data. The teacher then introduces the core definition of Machine Learning (Arthur Samuel's definition) and explains the fundamental shift: In traditional programming, humans input Rules and Data to get Answers. In Machine Learning, humans input Data and Answers (Labels) to get the Rules. The teacher uses the analogy of teaching a child to recognize an apple not by defining its molecular structure, but by showing them multiple apples until they recognize the pattern."

            "content": "The teacher walks through the lifecycle of a typical Machine Learning project using the 'Titanic Survival Prediction' example. The steps covered are: 1. Data Collection (gathering the passenger manifest). 2. Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, converting text to numbers). The teacher emphasizes that 80% of an ML engineer's time is spent here. 3. The Train/Test Split (separating data to ensure the model isn't just memorizing). 4. Training (the mathematical process of minimizing error). 5. Evaluation (testing against unseen data). [Image of Machine Learning pipeline workflow]. The teacher emphasizes that the code is often the smallest part of the pipeline compared to data engineering."

            "content": "The teacher introduces the concept of Generalization—the ability of the model to perform well on new, unseen data. This leads to the visual explanation of Overfitting (the model memorizes the noise in the training data, like a student memorizing specific answers but failing the test) vs. Underfitting (the model is too simple to capture the pattern). The session then shifts to Ethics and Bias. The teacher explains 'Garbage In, Garbage Out,' demonstrating how historical bias in training data (e.g., hiring data from the 1980s) leads to biased predictions in the future. The teacher encourages students to view models not as objective truth, but as reflections of the data they were fed."

The teacher uses the classroom webcam to gather live data (e.g., Class Standing vs. Class Sitting, or Teacher Waving vs. Teacher Drinking Water). The class watches the real-time process of: 1. Gathering samples (Data Collection). 2. Clicking 'Train' (Model Training). 3. Testing the model live (Evaluation). This visualizes the feedback loop discussed in the previous section."

The teacher provides a roadmap for next steps, suggesting beginner tools like Python, Scikit-Learn, or Pandas for those interested in the implementation side, and opens the floor for final questions regarding the capabilities and limitations of current AI technology."
